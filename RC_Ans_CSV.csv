"C"," This question focuses on the main idea of the passage. The reading constantly flips back and forth, taking one side at first, then another on the forecast for American entrepreneurship. The author is careful to present his or her arguments fairly and with some reservations (e.g., it is not clear thatâ€¦, suggests thatâ€¦, may seemâ€¦, does not necessarilyâ€¦, it may not bringâ€¦, can beâ€¦). Ultimately, the view is balanced, or nuanced. Regarding choice (A), the author does not propose changes. Regarding (B), the author never argues that any group of college students should (or should not) form their own companies. If anything, the author offers both sides of the issue, leaving it up to individuals to decide. Regarding (D), the author offers one fact about the varying rates at which businesses of two types (low-value and high-value) are founded. However, the author never evaluates the viability (or likelihood of success) of these types. As for (E), the analogy drawn in the last two sentences is not the main point of the passage; it is a final observation, one that sheds light on the issue, but this analogy is not the primary purpose for which the passage was written."
"B"," The question asks for a specific detail mentioned or clearly indicated in the text. You should look for very direct proof for the answer choice you pick. Specifically: College graduates, unable to find traditional jobs, instead opt to start their own businesses. You should look for a match for this concept, slightly reworded at most. Correct choice (B) matches the idea that college graduates are unable to find traditional jobs. Regarding (A), college graduates who start their own businesses may indeed be hampered by a lack of access to outside investment, but this is not offered as the reason that they start such businesses. Be careful of answer choices that restate truths from the passage but do not answer the specific question posed! As for (C), it may be true that low-value companies have become more prevalent, but again, this does not answer the specific question. Regarding (D), the choice between renting and buying property is offered only as an analogy, not as a literal choice for college graduates (let alone as the reason for their entrepreneurial decisions). Regarding choice (E), you are told nothing about how forecasts of the unemployment rate are likely to evolve."
"E"," This question asks you what â€œcan be inferredâ€ about the number of American high-value businesses. The answer choices reveal that specifically, you should focus on how this number has changed (or may have changed) during the course of the recent recession. For an Inference question, you will need proof from the passage, but you will typically need to transform that proof â€” you are not simply asked to look up a fact, and you should be wary of simply matching language in the text to language in the choices. However, you should also recognize that there is no fuzziness or room for interpretation. The answer you come to must be rock-solid. In particular, when you encounter mathematical language, you should take extra care to make our argument airtight mathematically. Looking up the key phrase high-value businesses, you find that the proportion of high-value businesses founded each year has declined. Watch out! As you know from the math side of the GRE, a proportion is not the same as a number. The proportion has fallen, but you are also told that the overall number of new business starts has been higher over recent years. If the overall number is up, but the proportion is down, you cannot tell whether the absolute number of high-value businesses is up or down. (E) is correct â€” what has happened to the number you want is unknown."
"C"," You are told that women went to war as nurses or in providing supplies and that such women, including many old women, died in battle. Therefore, Some of those who worked as nurses or in providing supplies died in battle. In (A), you do not know how other people felt about (lamented) or marked the deaths of anyone who died in battle. You also do not know anything about the courageousness of younger women (B), or anything about the status of men in Asante culture ((D) and (E))."
"E"," The first paragraph introduces bacterial â€œsuper-bugsâ€ with some alarm. The second paragraph increases the alarm, noting how many scientists argue that the human race has more to fear from viruses. This paragraph describes the way in which viruses hijack the cell, in order to illustrate how tough viruses are to treat. The last paragraph continues the comparison and puts a stake in the ground: bacteria lack the potential for cataclysm that viruses have. This last point is illustrated by the near- miss you have had with the HIV pandemic. As for choice (A), you are never told how bacteria infect the body. Regarding (B), the hijacking process is certainly described, but to make a larger point: why itâ€™s hard to eradicate viruses, in comparison with bacteria. As for (C), After reading this passage, you may want to call up the CDC and donate money, but the passage itself only raises a warning, if even that â€” it is not a call to action. Regarding choice (D), the last paragraph does highlight your good fortune, but this is not the larger point of the whole passage. (E) is correct â€” the passage compares the two threats (bacteria and viruses) and judges viruses to be far more important (after all, viruses have the potential for cataclysm)."
"B"," In this Inference question, you must be careful to focus on the keywords you are given: infections by bacteria (which you could rearrange to bacterial infections). What do you know from the text about bacterial infections? Toward the end of the second paragraph, one sentence gives you a direct clue: viral infections cannot be treated ex post facto in the way that bacterial infections can. So you can infer correctly that bacterial infections CAN be treated â€œex post factoâ€ (it means â€œafter the factâ€). You should look for a match to this idea. Choice (B) gives you what you want. The extra phrase by antimicrobial agents isnâ€™t much to add; this term is used at the beginning of the passage, and all it means is â€œstuff that works against microbes, i.e., bacteria.â€ Regarding (A), from the beginning of the second paragraph, you know that bacteria themselves reproduce asexually through binary fission, but you donâ€™t know that to be true about infections by bacteria. Regarding (C), resistance â€œcocktailsâ€ such as NDM-1 actually make bacteria â€œnearly impregnable.â€ So an infection by bacteria that have this cocktail would be less vulnerable, not more vulnerable. Choice (D) is true about viral infections, not bacterial infections. Choice (E) makes little sense; you know only that the virus does critical damage to the host cell. In fact, it does not seem that bacteria infect organisms in the same way, so it might not even make sense to speak of the â€œhost cellâ€ of a bacterium."
"A"," This Specific Detail question requires you to determine what is true about intracellular obligate parasites (or IOPs, to give them a temporary abbreviation). Going back to the passage, you read this: Whereas bacteria reproduce asexually through binary fission, viruses lack the necessary structures for reproduction, and so are known as â€œintracellular obligate parasites.â€ The word so toward the end tells you that the reason viruses are called IOPs is that they lack the necessary structures for reproduction. You are looking for this idea, perhaps slightly restated. (A) is correct."
"B"," Before reading the choices, it is helpful to determine for yourself what the main idea is. Is the passage really about supernovae, or is it about Galileo, the philosophers, and the ideas being discussed? The fact that the â€œtwistâ€ occurs in the second paragraph (youâ€™re not talking just about science â€” now youâ€™re talking about history and philosophy) supports the position that the second paragraph is more central to the main idea and that the first paragraph is just background information. Choice (A) is wrong because it does not mention the main content of the second paragraph, the ideas and assumptions that became controversial. It is also much too broad â€” giving a history of supernovae would take a lot more than two paragraphs. Choice (B) is correct â€” the passage does describe a â€œshift in thoughtâ€ (from an unchangeable â€œheavensâ€ to a more scientific view), and this shift (at least among intellectuals in Padua) was prompted by a â€œnatural eventâ€ (the supernova). Choice (C) is attractive (juxtapose means â€œto put next to one anotherâ€ or â€œto compareâ€), but does not describe the main idea. While Galileo and the philosophers certainly had different views about the bright light they saw in the sky, itâ€™s not clear that you can say that the philosophers had â€œviews about supernovaeâ€ in general. Choice (D) can be stricken simply due to â€œcorroborateâ€ (to prove true or support with evidence). The passage is describing, not making an argument. Finally, choice (E) is much too broad! You could spend an entire career discussing how science and philosophy interrelate. This passage covers a much more narrow topic."
"A"," Remember that Inference questions are not asking you to think for yourself. You must not make any assumptions or go beyond the information in the passage. Statement I is true because you can prove it with the first sentence of the second paragraph. In 1604 in Padua, Italy, a supernova became visible, appearing as a star so bright that it was visible in daylight for more than a year. Since this supernova was visible for more than a year, it is possible for supernovae to take more than a year to fade from view. (Note that if Statement I said â€œSupernovae always take more than a year to fade from view,â€ it would be wrong.) The second statement cannot be proven. Just because you are told that a supernova in 1604 caused a stir does not mean no one else had ever seen one before. The third statement also cannot be proven. You know that Galileo disagreed with the philosophers; you donâ€™t know that those particular philosophers ever changed their minds."
"C"," As a result of the supernova in 1604, Galileo gave popular lectures in which he â€œsought to explainâ€ the origin of the â€œstarâ€ and which â€œundermined the viewsâ€ of some philosophers. Thatâ€™s all you know. Choice (A) is a bit silly â€” was the Earth created after 1604? This choice took some wording from paragraph and twisted it around to trick us. Choice (B) is too extreme â€” you know that Galileo sought to explain the origin of the supernova, but you donâ€™t know that he succeeded. Choice (C) is true â€” you are told that the lectures were widely attended by the public. (A very picky person might point out that just because people go to a lecture doesnâ€™t mean they are interested, but all of the other answers are definitely wrong, so that confirms that this is a reasonable â€” that is, very tiny â€” inferential leap.) Choice (D) is attractive, but is a trap answer. You know that Galileo, in his lectures, â€œunderminedâ€ (weakened) the views of the philosophers. But you donâ€™t know what the philosophersâ€™ response was, and you certainly donâ€™t know whether the philosophers were opposed to the lectures themselves (a person could be opposed to the ideas in a lecture but still think the lecturer should be allowed to lecture). Choice (E) is also attractive because you, as a modern reader, know this to be true in real life. However, the question does not ask, â€œWhat really happened?â€ It asks â€œThe author mentions which of the following as a result of the supernova of 1604?â€ The author does not mention that the philosophers were â€œproved wrong.â€ (Their views were â€œundermined, which is much less extreme.) You cannot validate this answer choice with evidence from the passage."
"AC"," Kincaidâ€™s critics point out that Britainâ€™s government is not as corrupt as Antiguaâ€™s. Kincaid makes a witty rejoinder, but does not deny that the British government is less corrupt than Antiguaâ€™s. This, coupled with her stated belief that Britain is responsible for corruption in Antigua, justifies the first statement. As for the second statement, it would not be surprising if Kincaid did think this, but no governments of the â€œformer colonial empireâ€ are discussed in the passage except Antiguaâ€™s. Finally, the third passage refers to â€œAntiguaâ€™s current problems, including drug dealing and selling off land for tourist properties,â€ so the third statement is true."
"B"," In main idea questions, you can often eliminate one or more answers just based on the first word or phrase: relate, discuss, give a history, make a case, emphasize. Does the passage â€œmake a caseâ€? It doesnâ€™t â€” like almost all GRE passages, it is merely reporting facts and/or the opinions of others. Emphasize is also a bit strange â€” usually, the purpose of a passage is something a little bigger than just â€œemphasizingâ€ something. When you read the passage, you may have determined that the first paragraph simply gives background information about Don Giovanni, while the second paragraph gives the â€œtwistâ€ â€” even though almost the whole world loved Don Giovanni, people in Mozartâ€™s own hometown were less enthusiastic about it. Choice (B) matches this â€” the passages discusses how a work of art (the opera) has been met by diverging (different, diverse) responses, specifically those of Viennese audiences versus those of everyone else."
"A"," The full sentence is, The opera mixed traditions of moralism with those of comedy â€” a practice heretofore unknown among the composerâ€™s works â€” creating a production that was not well liked by conservative Viennese audiences. Regarding Mozartâ€™s mixing traditions of moralism with those of comedy, the clue a practice heretofore unknown among the composerâ€™s works tells you that Mozart had not done this before. Furthermore, the clue not well liked by conservative Viennese audiences tells you that Viennese audiences did not like this because it was a departure from tradition. Correct answer (A) is a good match â€” a â€œlackluster receptionâ€ means that those who â€œreceivedâ€ something (the audience) were holding unimpressed. Note that the GRE is trying to hide the correct answer from you a little bit by saying â€œa particular group of peopleâ€ for â€œViennese audiences.â€ Also note that (D) and (E) could be eliminated straightaway â€” the author does not â€œargueâ€ or â€œundermineâ€ (which would mean the author was arguing) at any point. Obviously, talking about moralism and comedy doesnâ€™t â€œremind the reader of the plotâ€ (B), and you have no idea (from the passage, at least) what is common in contemporary (modern) opera, so (C) is out of scope."
"E"," You know that Viennese audiences did not like the (new) mixing of moralism and comedy because the audiences were â€œconservative.â€ But thereâ€™s an even better clue: the passage says eighteenth century audiences in Vienna â€” Mozartâ€™s own city â€” were ambivalent at best. Ambivalent means â€œhaving mixed feelings or undecided.â€ At best is an expression meaning or worse. (E) is a direct match with a sentence from the passage. Note that (A) and (B) contain extreme language (purely, unequivocally). Choices (C) and (D) go too far. You have no indication that audiences were confused or offended, merely that they didnâ€™t like or had mixed feelings about a work of art."
"BC"," Regarding the first statement, watch out for extreme language! Redlining never â€œceasedâ€; you are told it may have continued in less explicit ways. The same part of the passage provides good support for the second statement â€” redlining has become less explicit, or overt. Finally, you are told that With no access to mortgages, residents within the red line suffered low property values. Thus, access to mortgages is related to higher property values."
"D"," You are told that reverse redlining occurs when predatory businesses specifically target minority consumers for the purpose of charging them more. Choices (A) and (B) describe regular redlining, the practice of denying service or constraining access to something like jobs. Redlining is about businesses, not police, so (C) is out. Choice (E) does mention targeting minority consumers, but does not give an example of offering inferior products or overcharging (reverse redlining is discriminatory, and choice (E) describes a perfectly normal ad campaign). Choice (D) is a perfect match, and a good example of what is described in the third paragraph."
"E"," In the first paragraph, you are told that With no access to mortgages, residents within the red line suffered low property values and landlord abandonment; buildings abandoned by landlords were then likely to become centers of drug dealing and other crimeâ€¦ The lack of access to mortgages is due to redlining. Thus, redlining causes landlord abandonment and the resultant effects â€” (E) is a perfect match. Note that (A) mentions â€œsubprime mortgagesâ€ and â€œdefaults,â€ which are never mentioned in the passage. (B) incorrectly cites reverse redlining rather than redlining. (C) gets the relationship between redlining and landlord abandonment backwards. (D) is just wrong â€” â€œconstrained access to health care, jobs, insurance, and moreâ€ is mentioned as part of the definition of redlining."
"AC"," You are told that â€œgermophobicâ€ Western society eschews premastiction, which provides â€œbeneficial bacteria,â€ so the first statement is true. The word only kills the second statement â€” watch out for extreme language! If just one person outside of the developing world premasticates food for a baby, this statement is false, so you cannot infer it. Finally, you are told that babies also received antibodies and digestive bacteria from the motherâ€™s saliva, so saliva has at least one benefit (antibodies) aside from digestive bacteria."
"B"," The author discusses Bois and Damischâ€™s metaphor (â€œa dynamic gameâ€), calls it misleading, and proposes an expansion beyond the competitive aspect. (A) is incorrect, as the author does not claim that the two artists were the best. (C) only addresses the details and evidence presented in the passage but not the main point. (D) and (E) are both distortions because the passage does not rank the painters, and these issues are again not the point."
"D"," This question type asks for a combination of the point, tone, and, perhaps, structure. The author expresses the point at the end of the first paragraph by suggesting that the rivalry between Picasso and Matisse was more of a dialogue or exchange. (A) is an incorrect comparison because the passage rejects the idea that such rivalries are mere competitions. (B) distorts a detail by adding an opinion not stated in the passage. The author writes about the artists employing multiple styles, but never implies they are masters because they employ multiple styles. (C) is a distortion based on misreading the â€œconversationâ€ metaphor. (E) is incorrect, as the word generally is a claim that the author does not make; you are only told about one particular rivalry."
"C"," In the last paragraph, the passage states that Matisse used the same palette in his work but omitted the green. (A), (D), and (E) are incorrect because they cite comments about Large Nude in a Red Armchair, not Woman with Yellow Hair. (B) is backwards â€” the passage states that Matisseâ€™s response, as opposed to Picassoâ€™s work, did not rigidly tie color to form."
"E"," In the third paragraph, the author refers to Matisse as the older artist. Choice (A) is not true; the phrase â€œsensuous, rich moodâ€ was used in the passage to describe a work by Matisse, not Large Nude in a Red Armchair. Choice (B) is wrong because the author, at the end of the passage, uses seems to be saying and that indicates that it was not actually said. (C) is incorrect â€” the passage states that they were â€œoccasional friends.â€ (D) is a distortion; the passage only says that Matisseâ€™s response came a decade later, not that he had worked on it throughout that time."
"B"," The authorâ€™s point was that the rivalry was more of a dialogue than a competition. (A) and (E) are not correct because those choices do not say anything about the nature of the rivalry and no more can be assumed. (C) is wrong because the authorâ€™s point was that their relationship was more than a competition. (D) misconstrues the metaphor that the author rejects."
"C"," The last paragraph devotes itself to highlighting the problematic implicit messages of timelines. (A) is a distortion; the author does not claim dates are unimportant but that historical study should go far beyond mere dates. (B) and (E) are backwards, as these are two of the implicit messages that the author rejects. (D), while quite likely, does not have to follow â€” the author implies that there is more to history than wars and minor battles, punctuated by the occasional presidential election and technological innovation but does not specify that content."
"D"," Essentially, this question tests vocabulary. The point of the passage is the problems with timelines, and the ending is a warning â€” portentous can mean â€œominously significant.â€ The words in (A) would never describe a GRE author. In (B), the author is not bemused, or amused, at all. Nor is the author resigned or complacent. (Note: it would be rare for a GRE author to be called negative, but this passage would arguably be just such a rarity.)"
"D"," The last paragraph discusses the negative implicit â€” or subliminal â€” issues with timelines. In that paragraph, since the author indicates that an implicit flaw is showing â€œonlyâ€ 64 events, it must follow that there are more. (A) is out. In the second paragraph, the author worries that the prominence of the dates will draw too much attention, so eliminate (B). In the first paragraph, the author says, Despite their usefulness in allowing students to gain a cursory knowledgeâ€¦ This means that timelines have some positive uses. cross off (C). As for (E), in the last paragraph, a flaw cited is that timelines portray an â€œofficialâ€ history; thus, unofficial histories must have virtues."
"B"," In the last paragraph, a listed implicit flaw is that the events are presented as independent â€” without context. The passage mentions their prominent placement (A) and use of photos (E), but does not suggest that these are the problems. (C) is false, as the passage states these timelines had beginnings and ends. Regarding (D), the author does not challenge the factual accuracy of timelines."
"C"," Myopic means â€œnear-sighted,â€ and the author employs it to describe the inability of some curricula to see the big picture. Similarly, purblind means â€œpartially blind or deficient in understanding.â€ (A), (B), and (D) are not justified by evidence from the passage â€” ignorance and bigotry are not mentioned as problems. Astigmatic indicates visual distortion, but the passage spoke of missing elements. Mordant, meaning â€œcaustic or corrosive,â€ has no connection to the passage."
"A"," The second paragraph further describes one of the two factors named in the first paragraph. (B) is incorrect because the passage does not contrast the factors (the second paragraph does not even mention the Diamond Necklace Affair). (C) is out of scope and irrelevant as the passage is about Marie Antoinetteâ€™s unpopularity, not the court or corruption. (D) is incorrect; the last paragraph discusses the results. (E), while arguably the main point of the passage, goes beyond that of the second paragraph, which does not discuss consequences."
"C"," The third paragraph mentions countless aristocrats who sued to the king on Rohanâ€™s behalf, so it must be true that a significant proportion was more loyal to the accused. Nothing in the passage refers to jealousy and nothing imputes that the queenâ€™s wealth was the cause of the aristocratsâ€™ dislike. (A) can be eliminated. (B) does not have to follow; the passage only says pamphlets were popular with the general public â€” it could, but doesnâ€™t have to be true that a large percentage of aristocrats read them. Similarly, the passage does not give such literacy rates so they, no matter how likely, cannot be assumed. (D) is out. (E) is completely out of scope."
"D"," This detail question concerns the second paragraph, which cites a reduction in royal censorship as a cause. (A) is out of scope; the education of women is never mentioned. (B) is a distortion; the passage says publications, not the literacy rate, tripled. (C) is incorrect, as the passage does not discuss the number of scandals over time. (E), however likely, is not mentioned in the passage."
"BC"," The first statement canâ€™t be proven â€” the passage does not indicate who the clever forger was. The second statement is correct â€” the passage identifies Rohan as a â€œsocial climber.â€ In the third paragraph, the author states that 10,000 people came to the doors of the Bastille demanding Rohanâ€™s release."
"A"," The point of the final paragraph is that the queenâ€™s unpopularity caused significant problems for the monarchy. You do not know if the queen met Rohan; she wouldnâ€™t have to meet someone personally to order that he be punished. The third statement is backwards: the queenâ€™s power must have had limits since Rohan was released despite her prosecution."
"C"," This is essentially a vocabulary question. Disinterested does not mean â€œuninterestedâ€ â€” it means â€œunbiased.â€ GRE authors are never described as arrogant or supercilious, as these words are too negative (and inappropriate). It is also very unlikely that prim, meretricious, or lascivious would be correct for the same reason. As for (E), the author is analytic, but no phrases or adjectives in the passage justify enthusiastic."
"C"," After the theory is described, the remainder of the passage cites studies and opinions that disagree in part or in whole. (A) is incorrect because no additional support is provided. (B) is incorrect, as the criticisms are not a screed, which is a long diatribe (and would be inappropriate from a GRE author). (D) is incorrect because it is not the authorâ€™s credentials that are questioned. (E) is wrong â€” there is no ridicule. Note that (B), (D), and (E) all express inappropriate attitudes for a GRE author. While authors can certainly argue for or against something, or express some enthusiasm or support, GRE authors do not rant and rave, and only very, very rarely ridicule, or question the integrity of those with whom they disagree."
"D"," In the second paragraph, Dâ€™Emilioâ€™s critics question his use of the word free. (A), (B), and (C) are topics that are not mentioned. (E) is at best a distortion â€” while one critic argues, in opposition to Dâ€™Emilio, that industrial capitalism worsened the position of women, the issue is not framed as one of sexism."
"E"," The Lowell Girls are mentioned to show that historically free labor has hardly been free at all. (A) is incorrect â€” that is the subject of the last paragraph, but does not concern the Lowell Girl (B) is incorrect â€” that is the subject of the third paragraph, but does not concern the Lowell Girls. The answer must come from the part of the passage referenced. (C) is backwards â€” this argument is put forth by Dâ€™Emlioâ€™s critics. (D) is a distortion, the reference is to show how historically normal this situation was, not to contrast two supposedly parallel groups of un-empowered workers."
"C"," The answer has to be something that must follow from the discussion of Davis in the last paragraph, not something that he or she could or likely would agree with. (C) is correct because Davis argues that women were the losers in a double-sense â€¦ leaving many women largely bereft of significant economic roles. If being â€œbereftâ€ of an economic role makes one a â€œloser,â€ it is not going too far (in fact, it is less extreme) to say that People without economic roles are disadvantaged. (A) is wrong, as it is an opinion of Dâ€™Emilioâ€™s mentioned in the first paragraph. (B) is wrong, as it is an opinion of Enloeâ€™s mentioned in the second paragraph. (D) In the last sentence of the passage, Davis actually states that the â€œentire economyâ€ has left the household."
"C"," A â€œbest titleâ€ question asks for the main point. The point of this passage was to highlight trenchant criticisms of Dâ€™Emilioâ€™s work â€” the lack of any rebuttal of these points indicates that the author sympathizes with them. (A), (D), and (E) are incorrect because they ignore that the passage concerns scholarly opinions rather than the history itself. (B) is incorrect, as no reconciliation is attempted. Additionally, (E) is closer to Dâ€™Emilioâ€™s view than the authorâ€™s."
"D"," â€œUniqueâ€ is a secondary meaning of peculiar. The author uses it in the context of Matisse learning something that Picasso had done. Of the wrong answers, (B) and (E) at best come from prohibited outside knowledge, whereas (A) and (C) are the opposite of the intended meaning â€” anything strange or unknown to Picasso would be something he doesnâ€™t do; peculiar to Picasso means something that heâ€™s known for doing."
"A"," The author both describes the work (The Ochre Head) and the inspiration for that work (Still Life with Ancient Head). (B) is a distortion, as the passage does not rate the painters. (C) is a distortion as the passage describes a painting but not how the artist developed his style. (D) is incorrect, as the passage indicates that this was a new direction rather than a representative work. (E) is out of scope because the passage only discusses two painters, not the art world."
"C"," While the author clearly appreciates the work, its place in the hierarchy is not discussed. (A) is incorrect â€” the passage states that colors â€¦ refuse to be constrained by definite lines of form. (B) is wrong as the end of the passage states that the paintingâ€™s composition references a Picasso work. (D) is backwards â€” the passage says the technique is not employed with the free reign used in Minotaur. (E) is wrong as the passage says a vase of flowers and a bench are depicted."
"C"," To answer a question of this type, one must find the other four choices in the text. In the third paragraph, (A) is mentioned verbatim. (B) is justified by â€œhearing speakers,â€ and (D) by â€œwrite autobiographical essays.â€ (E) is mentioned explicitly."
"D"," The passage, after establishing problems with textbooks, proposes film as a vehicle for teaching history. Since film is mentioned as a current alternative, it is being used now to teach history, but the author would like to expand this use. Didactic means â€œintended to instruct,â€ so films used to teach history would certainly qualify as a â€œdidactic tool.â€ (A) is out of scope and ignores the educational thrust. (B) and (C) do not include the bulk of the passage, which propose film as a learning tool. (E) is too negative â€” a GRE author would not denigrate â€” and philosophy is an inappropriate word for the passage (using textbooks is hardly a philosophy so much as just a common practice)."
"B"," The answer to detail questions must be found in the text, not through your own reasoning. The second paragraph quotes Wong to assert that committees wrongly value facts over perspectives, thus justifying â€œmisplaced priorities.â€ Leaving aside their merits, (A), (C), and (E) are not mentioned in the passage and outside knowledge is not allowed. (D) is the opposite of what you are looking for."
"B"," The final paragraph begins by mentioning the main criticism of this proposal but then argues that this supposed flaw is in fact a virtue and a golden opportunity. (A) and (D) ignore the authorâ€™s rebuttal to the criticism. (C) is problematic, as the paragraph is concerned with one particular tool â€” film. (E) ignores both the criticism and rebuttal and merely mentions an out-of-context detail."
"A"," In the last paragraph, the passage states that the main critique of the use of films to teach history is their rampant inaccuracies and biases. Then, the author goes on to argue that this can be a positive: these seeming flaws are actually part of the reason why film is an ideal teaching tool, because teachers can lead discussions of the filmâ€™s problems and biases. Thus, the author certainly argues that students can benefit from exposure to inaccurate accounts of history (not that students would always benefit, but that students can benefit when the inaccurate film is accompanied by critical analysis). The other choices cannot be justified. (B) does not have to follow; the passage only lists both as alternatives. (C) is too extreme â€” preferences do not equate to capacity. (D) is a preference of the state committees, not the students. (E) is backwards â€” the last paragraph states that students can benefit by such exposure."
"C"," The first statement is wrong, as the passage contrasts appealing, expressive paintings that are often the most popular museum attractions with constructivist, more recent art. The second statement is also wrong â€” the constructivist art, not the expressive paintings, is referred to as â€œbrainyâ€ in the passage. Note that these first two statements may very well be true in real life! But that is not what you are being asked. The question asks which statements can be inferred from the passage. The third statement is true â€” contemporary art is called â€œcoldâ€ in one sentence and â€œbrainyâ€ (or cerebral) in another sentence. In the final sentence of the paragraph, you are told that this brainy constructivist art is linked to expressive painting by using gesture as an expressive tool."
"ABC"," The author calls Iroquois: precarious, yet stable and balanced, which is a good match for the first statement (precarious and unstable are reasonable synonyms). The second statement is a good match for the final sentence, Iroquois resonates with an energy born not of the physical quality of the sculpture â€¦ but rather of the gestural quality of the forms. The third statement is a good match for the sentence, As one contemplates Iroquois â€¦ the linear forms became considerably more complex than one might presume. If the forms are more complex than one might think, it follows that some find the forms simpler than they really are."
"E"," (A) is wrong because Rousseau did argue for a social contract, meaning there should be some kind of law. (B) is wrong because Rousseau did not think members of a state should surrender their rights to a single person. (C) is wrong because Rousseau did argue that people could claim property if they needed it, implying the existence of private property in his ideal society. (D) is wrong because Rousseau did not want to dismantle the social contract entirely, but to replace it with his own ideal social contract. (E) is the answer because Rousseau desired a society where property can be taken â€¦ to the degree necessary for the subsistence of those taking it."
"B"," (A) is incorrect because you are told In a state of nature â€¦ the rich would have great difficulty protecting the property that they possess. This means the rich would still exist. (B) is correct because this is precisely what the sentence cited above says, while (C) is the opposite of what the passage says. (D) is wrong because the passage says the social contract is developed in order to protect the rich, and it must develop out of a pre-law state of nature. (E) is wrong because it comes from the fourth paragraph, which discusses Rousseauâ€™s vision for a perfect society, rather than a pre-law society."
"","To obtain assent to the contract, the rich focus their rhetoric on a seeming equality of obligation by creating rules that apply equally to all members of society. This is the sentence that shows how the wealthy are able to convince the poor to agree to the same social contract that will allow them to be defrauded. Be careful not to go looking in the passage for specific language mentioned in the question (hoarding or systematized) on select-the-sentence questions like these. More often than not, that will lead you to the wrong sentence."
"A"," Choice (A) is correct because the passage says that people should only take something if they need it (i.e., for survival). (B) is wrong because it is the exact opposite of what the passage says, in that people should not simply enrich themselves with property. (C) is wrong because though a house could be protection, thatâ€™s not what subsistence means. (D) is wrong because it isnâ€™t specific enough. (E) is wrong because it makes no sense at all."
"A"," Choice (A) is correct because Lackey believed that soldiers were not terrorists and Merari believed that state actors could not be terrorists. (B) is wrong because Merari never gave his opinion on the issue of civilian versus non-civilian attacks. (C) is wrong because while the passage argues that it is difficult to define the word terrorism, neither of the authors in question explicitly says it. (D) is wrong because neither author weighs in on that subject. (E) is wrong because Merari narrows the definition down to violence perpetrated by sub-state insurgent groups. An elite branch of a countryâ€™s military does not match this definition."
"E"," Choice (A) is wrong because it is the exact opposite of how sub-state is used in the passage. (B) is wrong because sub-state insurgent groups might be capable of terrorism, but they are not necessarily terrorist. (C) is wrong because it would be redundant when used in the sentence, and it has nothing to do with states at all. (D) is wrong because anarchists want to bring about a society without government; they do not simply operate outside of a governmentâ€™s jurisdiction. (E) is correct because Merari uses it to draw a contrast with governmental militaries, which he thinks are not capable of terrorist acts."
"B"," Choice (A) is wrong because Lackey discusses the difference between an act that targets innocents and one that targets soldiers. (B) is correct because though the passage does say that the term is prevalent in everyday conversation, this is not a reason that it is difficult to define. Note that just because a statement is true does NOT mean it is relevant to the specific question being asked! (C) is wrong because the third paragraph discusses these issues of circumstance. (D) is wrong because Merari discusses whether state actors can commit terrorist acts. (E) is wrong because Merari says that the broader the term becomes, the less useful it becomes in a dialogue, implying that this needs to be taken into account when trying to define the word, in order to maintain its utility."
"C"," The first statement is wrong because, while Baldwin takes issue with the average 1930â€™s Hollywood movie for failing to represent anything other than the dominant culture, that doesnâ€™t mean he would find an individual film focused on African American culture any better. It could be bad for other reasons. The second statement is wrong because even though a film that focused only on African American issues could be just as limited as one that failed to focus on such issues, there is a significant difference: one would be reinforcing the dominant culture, while the other would be presenting an alternative culture. Baldwin would thus be unlikely to find them equally problematic. The third statement is correct because the predominant culture in the 1930â€™s was white, so the film in question would be less likely to reinforce that culture, given that it would feature only African American issues and actors."
"D"," Choice (A) is wrong because the quotation has to do with children and their ability to relate to a given work of art, rather than the culture of power. (B) is wrong because the quote does not discuss white culture specifically. (C) is wrong because the passage never says that America was hungry for a writer like Baldwin â€” make sure not to insert your own ideas or outside knowledge. (D) is correct because even though the quote doesnâ€™t explicitly mention black children, the point is that children in general canâ€™t relate to a dilemma that doesnâ€™t relate to them. Because the passage tells you that Hollywood films of the era dealt with white issues and employed white actors, you know that they would not have related to black children, who would have thus been alienated from mainstream culture. (E) is wrong because the passage doesnâ€™t say that children couldnâ€™t derive any educational value from films they canâ€™t relate to, only that they would feel alienated because their lives would not be represented in the films."
"D"," Choice (A) is wrong because assiduous means â€œdiligent,â€ which is irrelevant here. (B) is wrong because the people studying art do not have to be artistic. (C) is totally off-base. (D) is correct because erudite means â€œknowledgeable,â€ and knowledge would allow someone viewing the frieze to recognize its unique qualities. (E) is wrong because this is a question of knowledge, not applying technical or scientific skills."
"C"," Choice (A) is wrong because many of its characteristics have in fact been worked out. (B) is wrong because the passage is not primarily about artistic interpretation. (C) is correct because sui generis means â€œunique,â€ and the frieze is said to be unique in two ways. (D) is incorrect because only one paragraph discusses the existence of mortals in the frieze, and because, of course, this title is much too broad. (E) is wrong because none of the characters are ever said to be â€œcontinuousâ€ (which doesnâ€™t actually mean anything)."
"D"," Choice (A) is incorrect because the first sentence tells you that the Parthenon was constructed in the High Classical Period. (B) is incorrect because the same sentence says that the Parthenon was regarded as a great architectural and artistic product. (C) is incorrect because the frieze is said to have come from the temple-chamber of the Parthenon. (D) is correct because the passage only says that it is difficult to reconstruct the frieze, not the Parthenon overall. (E) is incorrect because the frieze was part of the Parthenon and it is said to be unique."
"E"," Choice (A) is wrong because you have been told that many Greek works of art featured scenes from myths and legends. (B) is wrong because that kind of frieze exists in the Parthenon, so it would not be unique. (C) is wrong for the same reason as (A). (D) is wrong because you are told that scientists regularly make an inventory of figure-types and characters on a given incomplete frieze to try to work out what went in the missing spaces. (E) is correct because the passage says that the frieze featured the first mortals in the history of Greek art. Thus, no murals from that time have done this (according to the passage)."
"C"," Choice (A) is wrong because the passage only discusses the ways in which Sandra Cisnerosâ€™s work puts the burden on the reader. (B) is wrong because the passage only discusses a single one of Isabel Allendeâ€™s books. (C) is correct because the second paragraph says that Sandra Cisnerosâ€™s short story collection does have interrelated stories, but they do not use the same characters or setting in each story. (D) is wrong because intuition is not actually a part of Sandra Cisnerosâ€™s writing. (E) is wrong because the passage does not compare short story collections with interrelated stories to short story collections without interrelated stories."
"E"," Choice (A) is wrong because while tone is mentioned in relation to Sandra Cisnerosâ€™s work, it is not mentioned in relation to Isabel Allendeâ€™s work. (B) is wrong because while time is mentioned in relation to Sandra Cisnerosâ€™s work, it is not mentioned in relation to Isabel Allendeâ€™s work. (C) is wrong because while similarities in characters is mentioned in relation to Isabel Allendeâ€™s work, it is directly said not to exist in Sandra Cisnerosâ€™s work. (D) is wrong because while setting is mentioned in relation to Isabel Allendeâ€™s work, it is directly said not to exist in Sandra Cisnerosâ€™s work. (E) is correct because character and setting are mentioned in relation to Isabel Allendeâ€™s work, while only mood, circumstance, time, tone, and imagery are mentioned in relation to Sandra Cisnerosâ€™ work."
"AB"," Statement I is correct because Rothbard only says that there were better [economists] than Smith. That means that at least two were better than Smith, but Smith could still have been the third best (you certainly donâ€™t know that Rothbard actually thinks that Smith comes in third place, but the question asks for statements that simply do not contradict Rothbardâ€™s remarks). Statement II is correct because Rothbard says that Smithâ€™s book â€œeclipsed public knowledgeâ€ of better economists, meaning it had influences that it shouldnâ€™t have. The third statement is not correct because of the first line of the third paragraph, Even Smithâ€™s critics do not deny the bookâ€™s immense influence."
"C"," The â€œInvisible Handâ€ is described as the idea that individuals pursuing their own self- interest could unintentionally create a more just society. (A) is wrong because no one is acting all that selfishly here, nor is the final result particularly just â€” this would be a better choice if the moviegoersâ€™ actions somehow caused a benefit to people other than themselves. (B) is wrong because it has little to do with selfishness or justice, but with another aspect of Smithâ€™s writings. (C) is correct because this system promotes selfishness (each student tries to sign up as quickly as possible for each class, without thinking of others), but those classes are then said to be â€œequitably distributed.â€ (D) is wrong because raising prices isnâ€™t inherently selfish, no one appears to be competing, and the end result is not particularly just. (E) is wrong for the same reasons as (D)."
"D"," The passage clearly indicates that Chanel and Vionnet are examples illustrating a theory that personal virtues are â€œirrelevantâ€ to material success. (A) is a distortion, as â€œirrelevantâ€ indicates no relationship, not an inverse one. (B) confuses an example given in the passage with the purpose of the passage, and creates a hierarchy that the passage did not. (C) again confuses example and purpose; furthermore, the passage does not focus on aesthetics. (E) is an irrelevant comparison and also confuses example and purpose."
"B"," When a question uses the phrase â€œin order toâ€ the correct answer will address the authorâ€™s purpose for inserting the detail rather than the literal meaning. (A) is at best unknown, as her company was in operation before the war. (B) is correct because the information supports the authorâ€™s theory that personal virtue is irrelevant to material success. (C) comes from the wrong paragraph, as this information about Vionnet does not â€œhighlightâ€ anything about Chanel. (D) is out of scope and not supported by anything in the passage. (E) is a distortion; the author mentions that Vionnet could be so thought of, but his point is merely about her personal integrity and does not address said credentials."
"D"," In the first paragraph, the passage states that seals who sleep on land at night but spend most of their days in coastal waters are analogous. None of the other choices accurately follows the pattern of this analogy."
"C"," The author contrasts her to trained scientists and, having given criticisms of the theory credence, sides with them. (A) is nonsensical â€” as a â€œproponent,â€ she is not objective by definition. To an extent, (B) reverses the authorâ€™s point of view; it is irrelevant because the passage does not address this issue. (D) is exactly backwards. (E) brings up an issue that is not mentioned and does not have to follow from the text."
"D"," The author states that the Tokugawa period in Japan was a model for patterns of organization, and writes, as psychologists, social historians, and Biblical prophets have all observed, in varying ways, humans inevitably fail to anticipate unintended consequences. This certainly qualifies as a â€œcommon failing.â€ (A) is incorrect, as Iceland is only mentioned briefly as an analogy. (B) is wrong both because the author does not express a point of view and because the issue is the result rather than the imposition of a fixed order. (C) addresses a very minor detail, not the purpose. (E) is a comparison that the passage does not address and therefore cannot be inferred."
"C"," The author states that the inversion of the financial and social rankings led to the decline of Tokugawa society. (A) and (B) are both incorrect because the passage states that social mobility was prohibited and that facet of the society became problematic. (D) does not necessarily support that pointâ€”for one, no reason for any such revolt can be assumed. (E) is also incorrect; while the author does mention foreign pressure as leading to the collapse of the government, the question concerns the decline of the society, which began long before Admiral Perryâ€™s arrival."
"C"," The author states that unifying Germany under Prussian rather than Austrian rule made war more likely. (A) is a result of the treaty but the author does not imply that it was negative. (B) is based on information from the first paragraph and is irrelevant to this question. (D), while true, is unmentioned in the passage and thus not correct. (E) is wrong because it is a distortion to state that the author thought unifying Germany itself was the problem."
"A"," The passage mentions the military brilliance of Prinz Eugen of Savoy, so (A) must be true and is correct. (B) and (E) are both incorrect because the author does not create hierarchies of importance in either case, thus no particular ranking must be true. (C) and (D) are incorrect because the passage does not indicate who won and who lost."
"B"," The author discusses two ideas, but subtly dismisses the objectivity of the firstâ€™s adherents in the last sentence of the first paragraph. Phrases such as it is no wonder indicate an implicit sympathy for the second suggestion. (A) distorts the point, as â€œtheoriesâ€ are not the same as ideas, the two ideas are not exactly â€œopposing,â€ and the issue is not a â€œprocess.â€ (C) is incorrect â€” the last sentence of the passage undermines â€œdefinitivelyâ€ and â€œprogramsâ€ are not the same as ideas. (D) is wrong because dearth means â€œlack,â€ and Lewisâ€™s work is certainly very popular. (E) is incorrect because, in addition to missing the point, there is no critique, only a very brief description."
"D"," The passage only notes that Lewisâ€™s topics include both baseball and finance; the parallels mentioned are between the protagonists, not the professions. (A) is incorrect; â€œgaming the systemâ€ is idiomatic. (B) is incorrect; the fourth sentence of the second paragraph describes Lewisâ€™s protagonists. (C) is incorrect; movie making, used as evidence, is part of popular culture. (E) is incorrect; the introductory discussion of Lewisâ€™s education can fairly be called a mention of formative influences."
"C"," Statement I is wrong because a person driving his own car isnâ€™t a public service (the skateboarder is also a pretty transparent play on the idea of a â€œriderâ€). II is wrong because the free rider problem concerns people enjoying benefits without paying for them, not people paying different amounts for the same service. III is correct because in this instance, the action of many free riders leads to a systemic problem."
"C"," Choice (A) is wrong because nowhere in the passage is it stated that free riders cannot be blamed. (B) is wrong because nowhere in the passage is it stated that free rider problems are not worth worrying about. (C) is correct because the first sentence of the last paragraph says that in some cases, the free rider problem is viewed as a necessary cost of government, implying that in other cases, it is not. (D) is incorrect because national defense is cited as an example of the inevitability of free rider problems, not as proof that they need to be stamped out as quickly as possible. (E) is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the morality of free riders."
"AC"," Regarding the first statement, the passage claims modern humans are known to have diverged hundreds of thousands of years before modern humans left Africa. To say that they diverged is to say that two species share a common ancestry to that point. Regarding the second statement, whether modern humans and Neanderthals interbred is a matter of controversy (The teamâ€™s conclusions were answered with skepticism on a number of fronts) and thus this answer cannot be definitely true. Finally, although the passage does not endorse the claim that modern humans and Neanderthals interbred between 60,000 and 100,000 years ago, it treats as given the claim that the two species lived near one another during that interval (for roughly forty thousand years of that window Neanderthals and modern humans lived near one another in the Middle East)."
"C"," The passage says that Paleontologists and archaeologists charged that the conclusion was unsupported by archaeological evidence, so they appeal to archaeological evidence to criticize Paaboâ€™s conclusions. Statement I is wrong because there is no suggestion that the contamination of Neanderthal DNA with modern human DNA was deliberate, nor even that it was done by Paabo, nor is any other reason offered to doubt his integrity. Statement II is wrong because there is no suggestion that they ignore DNA evidence, even if they are not as persuaded by it as Paabo and his team."
"D"," The passage claims that the reflecting surface must be far enough away so that the sound of the echo is distinct from the original sound, but not so far away that the sound is completely dissipated. You can use that information to eliminate (A) and (B). The passage also claims that multiple reflecting surfaces are apt to produce a reverberation rather than an echo, so you can cross off (C). The anechoic chamber is said to prevent echoes with sound-absorbing fiberglass wedges, so (E) is also out."
"BC"," The echo chamber is constructed with the acoustical properties of a small cathedral precisely in order to create echoes. Mountains, along with buildings, are offered as an example of the sort of reflecting surface likely to bring about an echo."
"A"," The first statement is justified because in the second paragraph, de Beauvoir is quoted as saying exactly so. The second statement is not justified because at the end of the first paragraph, de Beauvoir indicates that women are viewed as intrinsically passive and immanent. This does NOT mean that de Beauvoir believes this (in fact, the second paragraph gives good evidence that she believes precisely the reverse). The third statement is not justified because, although de Beauvoir views both self-constraint and imposed constraint (oppression) as negative, she does not indicate which type she considers to be worse."
"B"," In the first paragraph, the passage states that immanence is considered â€œa degradationâ€ before going back and forth between immanence as a freely chosen moral fault and immanence as the result of oppression. Thus, immanence is not always characterized as either."
"D"," The first sentence of the passage tells you that existentialist ethics were a major influence on de Beauvoirâ€™s philosophy. Much of the rest of the passage is devoted to explaining that philosophy. (A) is too broad, as the passage doesnâ€™t explain all of existential ethics, of which transcendence is just one concept. Similarly, (B) is too broad as the passage does not discuss all of feminist theory, just de Beauvoirâ€™s. (C) is wrong â€” the passage is not a diatribe (the word diatribe is almost certainly inappropriate to describe any GRE passage). Choice (E) is again too broad and off the point."
"A"," The authorâ€™s primary purpose in writing this passage is to explain the distinction between science and non-science via historical examples, such as those of Aristotle and Galileo. The author begins by positing the question of differentiating the two, and then goes on to use historical examples to explain why each does or does not meet the qualification for modern science. In (B), the author never criticizes the Ancient Greek philosophers, just labels their method unscientific. In (C), nowhere does the author claim that it is important to follow Galileoâ€™s scientific method, just that this is now the modern definition of science. Regarding (D), the author never makes mention of the historical definition of science. In (E), the author never argues that the findings of Galileo are more important than those of Aristotle. Further, the author only discusses one finding of each philosopher/scientist, so this answer is out of scope."
"D"," Galileoâ€™s method forced one to first form a hypothesis, then design an experiment to confirm or deny this hypothesis, and then accept or discard the hypothesis based on oneâ€™s findings. Aristotleâ€™s hypothesis was that solids were the least expanded form of matter, and the experiment he designed to prove this was to show that solids sank within liquids of the same type. As this did not hold true for water, under the Galilean method Aristotle would be forced to discard his hypothesis based on the results of his experiment. Regarding (A), the passage does not contain any information about the shape of solid water or of other solid forms of matter, only about Aristotleâ€™s conjectures on the shape of solid water. Regarding (B), the passage claims the opposite of this fact: that an object with larger mass will not fall to the ground more quickly than an object with lesser mass. As for (C), the passage states that the ancient Greeks were more philosophers than scientists, but never prohibits one from being both. As for (E), the passage states that Galileo used his scientific method to disprove many commonly held misconceptions about the rules of physics, but never states that you cannot do this in the absence of his method."
"C"," The passage describes the role of Alcottâ€™s women in their society and briefly wonders about the authorâ€™s motivation. (A) concerns only the last sentence of the passage. (B) and (D) ignore that the passage discusses a novel rather than reality. (D) is also too broad and somewhat nonsensical since the passage concerns the past. (E) misses the authorâ€™s tone â€” there is no indictment, merely a discussion."
"E"," In the second paragraph, the passage dismisses Megâ€™s taking part by saying it meant no more than talking to her husband, remaining home, and allowing him to be a mediator between her and the world. (A) misses the point of the passage and is almost backwards. (B) and (C) are misplaced details about the alternative to taking part. (D) distorts the second paragraph, which said her husband was her mediator instead of her taking part."
"AC"," The first statement is justified, as the first sentence states that the man of the house was at the warfront. The third statement must follow, because the passage states that men went out in public to conduct activities and returned home at night. The second statement, while quite possibly true, is not mentioned in the passage. The passage only states that Alcott glorified this condition in her novel, not that the entire society did so. Do not bring in outside information or make assumptions!"
"E"," A falsifiable idea is â€œone that can be shown to be false.â€ The statement no human being lives forever can only be shown to be false if one observes a human being that lives forever. However, this would be impossible (because of the word forever), and thus the idea is not falsifiable. In addition, answer choices (A) through (D) are incorrect. The statement all birds are black is falsifiable by identifying a single bird that is not black. The statement Earth is the only planet in the universe with intelligent life can be proven false by finding intelligent life on any planet in the universe except Earth. The statement It rains on Mars everyday can be proven false by observing Mars on a single non-rainy day. The statement The sun will explode in 100,000 years can be proven false by waiting more than 100,000 years and verifying that the sun has not exploded. Note that choices (D) and (E) seem somewhat similar â€” however impractical it is to wait 100,000 years to falsify something, there is still a big difference between â€œ100,000 yearsâ€ and â€œforever.â€"
"B"," The author states in the last paragraph that a theory that is unable to be proven true is very unlikely to be formed. Therefore, it appears that he/she believes that â€œconfirmabilityâ€ lacks a practical application. The author states, it is understandable that Popper does not devote that much time to the criterion of â€˜confirmability,â€™ inferring that confirmability is less important that falsifiability, not more. You can eliminate (A). Regarding (C), the author states that a theory that is unable to be proven true is unlikely to be formed, therefore it is unlikely he/she believes that confirmability applies to a broad range of theories. As for (D), in the first sentence of the last paragraph, the author states that confirmability follows the same logic as falsifiability (â€œBy that logic,â€¦â€) and thus it appears he/she believes that comfirmability is reasonable. As for (E), the author states, it is understandable that Popper does not devote that much time to the criterion of â€˜confirmabilityâ€™. Thus, the author is unlikely to agree that Popper should have developed the idea of confirmability."
"C"," The second paragraph focuses on the significance of the two definitions of â€˜politicalâ€™, as (C) states. (A) is incorrect because no alternative is offered in the second paragraph. (B) is incorrect because there is no â€œrevisionâ€ â€” this choice might describe the third paragraph. Similarly, in (D), there is no â€œexception.â€ (E) is closer to the point of the first paragraph."
"B"," The author mentions the play as an example, or â€œillustration,â€ of when speech is political, which is the aspect discussed in that paragraph. (A) is incorrect, as it is used as an example, not counterpoint. (C) is wrong because the passage does not advocate a position. (D) and (E) miss the point of the example, which is neither about universality nor a fallacy."
"E"," The passage states that the hegemonic model believed governments to operate exclusively through law and the threat and enforcement of concrete punishment, such as imprisonment, monetary penalties, etcâ€¦ which legitimizes law and supports the exercise of power. (A), (B), and (C) all exemplify a using the rule of law to exact concrete punishments. (D) does not demonstrate a clear punishment, but does represent a clear exercise of power (the ability to censor an exhibit). Only (E) does not represent the use of law and punishment, as a coup would necessarily not be legal."
"A"," The answer to this type of question is always explicit in the passage. In the third paragraph, the passage cites Hanna Pitkin: public-spirited conversation happens when citizens speak in terms of â€˜justice.â€™ None of the other choices is mentioned in this section of the passage."
"","Such a definition is not precisely wrong, but rather is outdated  falls shortâ€¦ (second sentence of first paragraph). This is the only one of the four sentences in paragraphs 1 and 2 that includes an explicit criticism."
"B"," The passage describes two different ideas, explanationism and predictionism, that have both been used to verify or disprove different scientific theories. As for (A), the passage never states that either theory is superior to the other. Although (C) is true, the passage only mentions the two models of the solar system as an example of the workings of explanationism. Therefore, it cannot be the main idea of the passage. Regarding (D), the passage does not describe what is required to posit a physical theory. As for (E), a predictionist and an explanationist will always diverge on how to prove that a scientific theory is true, but they might still agree on whether or not the theory is correct."
"E"," Before citing the example of the Copernicus and Brahe models of the universe, the author states, it could be the case that a theory predicts something and yet does not provide the best explanation of it. The author goes on to use Copernicus and Brahe as an example, stating that both of their theories have predictive power, but obviously Braheâ€™s does not offer the best explanation for the workings of the solar system. As for (A), the author is actually arguing the opposite: that predictive power alone is never enough to verify a theory. (B) does reveal that some theories have more or less of an ad-hoc quality, but this is not the authorâ€™s reason for citing this example. The main reason must be related back to explanationism. As for (C), the example showed the opposite â€” both theories were found to accurately predict future events, and thus they must have both made the same predictions for those future events. Although it is true that the more complicated model failed (D), the authorâ€™s intent was to show that an incorrect model can still make correct predictions."
"AB"," The words for example at the beginning of the sentence containing the crowd analogy follow a sentence about the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle says that fermions cannot inhabit the same fundamental state. Electrons, which are fermions, are likened to members of a crowd in a stadium; the fact that electrons cannot circle the nuclei of atoms in precisely the same orbits (just as crowd members cannot sit on top of one another) is a â€œconsequenceâ€ of the Pauli exclusion principle. Thus, the first statement is justified. These electrons must occupy more and more distant locations; the crowd analogy certainly illustrates that behavior, so the second statement is justified. As for the third, incorrect statement, while you do know that electrons cannot occupy the same orbits as one another and must instead occupy more and more distant locations, you do not know that those orbits are â€œconcentricâ€ or â€œevenly-spaced.â€"
"B"," The author begins by naming the two classes of subatomic particles, and then divides the remainder of the passage into descriptions of each class and their relation to each other. Regarding (A) and (D), the author explains both of these concepts within the passage, but it is subordinate to the main idea of describing the two types of subatomic particles, and thus is not the primary purpose of the passage. As for (C) and (E), the authorâ€™s primary purpose in writing is not to provide examples or to argue."
"C"," The author states that fermions, not bosons, are the constituents of ordinary matter. All other answers are mentioned in the second paragraph of the passage."
"D"," The passage states that Cooper pairs of electrons will flow in perfect harmony and with zero resistance through the metal. As an example of the same phenomenon, you are told that a swirl in a cup of superfluid helium will never dissipate. Therefore, it is correct to infer that a current through a superconducting wire will never dissipate. If you were not certain that you could be sure of this, you can still eliminate the other choices through process of elimination. As for (A), the passage states that an even number of fermions (which, according to the first paragraph, include electrons, protons, and neutrons) constitute a boson, but not an odd number (1/2 integer times an odd will not give an integer). The last paragraph states that scientists argue for the existence of skyrmions in a medium that might permit them to be formed, implying that they have not yet been discovered, so eliminate (B). In (C), the author states that two electrons cannot circle a nucleus in the same orbit, but they could spin in different orbits that are the same distance from the nucleus. Finally, in (E), the author gives two examples of fermions becoming bosons at cooled temperatures, but does not say this is the only situation in which this can occur."
"A"," The first paragraph states that fermions obey the Pauli principle, according to which no two particles can occupy the same fundamental state. The second paragraph states that bosons tend to bunch together in exactly the same state. This is the opposite of (E), thus (E) is incorrect. (D) is also the opposite of what the passage claims. Bosons have integral spin values and fermions have half- integer spin. Answer (B) is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the total number of particle types for bosons for fermions and answer (C) is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that both fermions and bosons can exist in groups."
"A"," The passage states that the Pauli principle prohibits any two particles from inhabiting the same fundamental state. Further, you know that the Pauli principle should be applied to fermions, which include electrons, protons, and neutrons, but not bosons (from the second paragraph). Answer choice (A) discusses electrons, which are fermions, avoiding occupation of identical energy levels, so (A) is relevant and thus the correct answer. As for (B), a charged particle in a magnetic field neither provides the criteria for a fermion nor references inhabitance of the same state. Answer (C) does not specify the type of particle. Answer (D) is about photons, which are stated in the passage as bosons, to which the Pauli principle does not apply. Regarding (E), the passage explicitly states that the Higgs particle is a boson, so the Pauli exclusion principle definitely wouldnâ€™t apply here (the beginning of the second paragraph explains this quite clearly)."
"C"," You are told that Frey points out that humans are often intrinsically motivated, and that such motivation explains heroism, craftsmanship, and other drives that do not fit neatly into the model of a narrowly focused gain-seeker. The first statement is incorrect because the craftsman in question is working for money, rather than for the inherent love of the work. The second statement is incorrect because even though the journalist may appear to act heroically, his motivations are related to his career. The third statement is correct because the economist in question is working without hope of monetary reward."
"D"," (A) is incorrect because the passage never says that Homo economicus is a useful way to form mathematical models. (B) is incorrect because the passage never says Homo economicus is a theoretically useless construction, only that it is a problematic one. (C) is wrong because thereâ€™s no reason to believe that the people who criticize the theory donâ€™t fully understand its function. (D) is correct because the second paragraph of the passage describes numerous problems with Homo economicus, all of which center around simplifying peopleâ€™s motivations and assuming they understand more than they actually do. (E) is incorrect because the passage never says that Homo economicus fell out of favor. You donâ€™t know that the handful of critics cited is representative of â€œmost economists.â€"
"AC"," Statement I is correct because of Veblen and Keynes, who allege that homo economicus assumes far too great an understanding of macroeconomics on the part of humans. II is incorrect (and too extreme) because, although Tversky says that people are unconcerned by small chances of large losses, but quite risk-averse regarding small losses, he does not imply that there is a broader pattern. Statement III is correct because of Amartya Sen, who says that people can and do commit to courses of action out of morality, cultural expectations, and so forth."
"D"," The gist of this sentence is that while scientists condemn certain practices as flawed, the methods they themselves use are subject to many of the same flaws, according to Feyerabend. You are thus looking for a word, synonymous with repudiate, that means to â€œcondemn, censure,â€ or â€œdenounce.â€ Decry is the right word."
"A"," According to the passage, Feyerabend wants to demonstrate that historic instances of scientific progress were themselves marked by these flaws, and thus should not be seen as flaws at all. To this end, he describes a situation that any scientist would agree is an example of progress, and shows how it made use of practices that are now condemned by scientists, including â€œbegging the question,â€ the practice of using a conclusion as evidence for that same conclusion (a little bit like using a vocabulary word in the definition for that same word), and using â€œpropaganda.â€ Feyerabend basically implies that scientists have a choice between throwing this out as an example of good science or accepting these practices as part of good science. Since scientists are unlikely to say that the introduction of heliocentrism was a bad thing, they will be forced to revise their account of what is and is not acceptable scientific practice. Choice (B) is wrong because the point of the case study is that Galileo is a good example of science. As for choice (C), â€œsubjectivityâ€ is called â€œseriously flawedâ€ in the first paragraph. Choice (D) is nonsensical â€” it basically says tautological reasoning is acceptable only when itâ€™s being tautological. Itâ€™s certainly not why Feyerabend makes use of a case study. (E) misses the point completely â€” Feyerabend is using an example from history to defend certain ways of doing science."
"C"," The first sentence of this paragraph defines Boalâ€™s work as a response to a culture of apathy. (A) is incorrect â€” the paragraph describes a response, not an elaboration. (B) is incorrect because it is not until the last paragraph that the author provides a rationale for the two theatres. (D) is beyond the scope of the passage. (E) is incorrect because there is no evaluation and the styles are not contrasting."
"D"," This is essentially a vocabulary question. â€œPowerâ€ is one meaning of agency, and this is the only meaning that makes sense in the context of creating ways to free themselves. (A) and (B) are other meanings of agency that do not make sense in context. (C) might be related to agent but has no relationship to agency or the passage here. (E) is incorrect as it implies domination over others."
"E"," The last paragraph defines a â€œspect-actorâ€ as someone who simultaneously witnesses and creates theater. In the second paragraph, the passage states that at image events everyone is at once theater-maker and witness. (A) is incorrect, as theater is not mentioned. In (B), Boal specifically says that catharsis keeps people passive (also, the audience member is not acting, which is crucial to being a â€œspect-actorâ€). (C) is incorrect and, to an extent, backwards â€” the passage said that Boal found that position analogous to that of a passive audience. (D) is too broad, given the first paragraph about traditional theater."
"A"," At the end of the first paragraph, the author paraphrases Boal: theater etiquette creates a kind of culture of apathy where individuals do not act communallyâ€¦ and remain distanced from art. (C) and (E) can be eliminated. (B) and (D) are wrong because Boal states that traditional theater discourages political action by providing catharsis. (A) is correct because Boal states that actors do go into the audience, so they are not prevented from doing so."
"D"," This choice is a characteristic of an Image workshop, not a Forum workshop. In the second paragraph, the passage states that Forum workshops begin with a narrative skit (A) then the facilitatorâ€” or mediator (E) â€” encourages spectators to assume the role of the protagonist (B). Choice (C) is justified as the paragraph states that performances do not always arrive at a satisfactory solution."
"B"," In the third paragraph, the natural rotation of a galaxy, surrounding supernovae, and density waves are listed as examples of the outside influence evidently required for a theoretically unstable cloud to initiate collapse. The first statement is a trap â€” fusion appears in the first paragraph and the author does not suggest that it leads to cloud contraction. (While the passage does suggest that fusion is related to supernovae and that supernovae can contribute to cloud collapse, donâ€™t fill in the gaps yourself â€” the passage simply does not provide enough information for you to infer that fusion is part of a series of events that begins cloud contraction.) The second statement is true (realizing this requires you to match up â€œexplosions of starsâ€ in the answer choice with â€œsupernovaeâ€ in the third paragraph). The third statement is a distortion â€” forcing debris inward, not outward, may cause cloud contraction to begin."
"D"," Choice (A) is true in real life, of course, but is not mentioned in the passage. (B) refers to the molecular clouds in the second paragraph, not to our solar system. (C) is reminiscent of this sentence in the third paragraph â€” The natural rotation of a galaxy can slowly alter the structure of a cloud â€” which does not refer to our solar system. Correct answer (D) reflects that for a system of planets such as our solar system to form around a star during cloud contraction, the presence of these heavy elements in the cloud is a necessity. (You are also told that these heavy elements make up the Earth and even human bodies â€” so, they sound pretty necessary!) Choice (E) gets the story backwards â€” heavy elements were needed to create the solar system, not vice-versa."
"C"," The outward thermal pressure of the constituent gases (of the molecular cloud) is what is overcome in the process of the collapse of the cloud. This is something that inhibits, or holds back, cloud collapse."
"C"," The Norton-Polk-Mathis House uses typical Renaissance ideals as well as materials prevalent in the Italian Renaissance. However, the passage certainly does not say that the house itself was built in the Renaissance. (For one, it is in San Antonio!) The first statement is not true. According to the passage, the primary purpose of the building is â€œto impress,â€ so its purpose is not primarily utilitarian. The second statement is also not true. You are told that the house radiates an air of strength, especially when juxtaposed with the other, seemingly fragile brick and wood homes of the neighborhood, so you definitely can infer that the house â€œappears stronger than other nearby homes.â€ The phrase â€œradiates an airâ€ and the word seemingly in the passage indicate that you are talking about appearances of strength, so the word appears in the third statement is a very good match (you would not be justified in inferring that the other neighborhood homes are actually weak â€” they just look that way)."
"C"," The most important idea in the passage is that a small group of dolphins has been found to form social networks, which is a first among non-human animals. One indication of this is that both the first and last sentences in the passage highlight this fact. Answer choice (A) is stated in the passage, but is not the main idea; it explains the behavior of the animals that form social networks. (B) is never stated in the passage, although this study did span a relatively long time. (D) is a much bigger claim than the passage ever suggests; you are never given a motivation for this study. Finally, choice (E) goes against the main idea of the passage as the passage discusses how dolphins can form social networks."
"A"," The passage states that other animals aside from the sponger dolphins often form groups based on circumstances such as genetics or food sources. As the dolphins are the first to be categorized as â€œsocial networks,â€ it must be true that groups formed under the previous circumstances would not qualify as social networks. For the second statement, the passage does not state that all spongers of Shark Bay form social networks, only the females. As for the third statement, the passage does not comment on the location of spongers; it only mentions the spongers of Shark Bay. Thus, you cannot infer that this is true."
"E"," You are told that this belief is an â€œold canard.â€ A canard is a â€œrumor,â€ or â€œa false or baseless story.â€ An â€œold canardâ€ is one that has been passed around for awhile â€” very much analogous to an â€œurban legend.â€ You are then told that the blind people in the study have â€œcerebral superpowersâ€ and that the discovery that blind people can hear better than sighted people is â€œa stunning example of the brainâ€™s plasticity.â€ Thus, (E) is correct."
"B"," You are told that Aristotle posited a holistic, non-corporeal mind and that he would have found â€œshockingâ€ the idea that â€œthe mind is physically located in the brain.â€ Thus, the first statement is not correct, since Aristotle believed in a â€œnon-corporealâ€ (not part of the body) mind. Since Aristotle believed in a â€œholisticâ€ mind, he did NOT think that the mind exists in parts or modules. Thus, the second statement is correct. As for the third statement, you have no way to know what Aristotle might have thought about blind peopleâ€™s hearing."
"C"," The last sentence tells you that the deportation of German-speaking citizens by the Allied powers is excised from history books because history is written by the victors â€” this makes the first statement look attractive, but the statement says during World War II. The passage is clear that the deportations took place almost two years after the conclusion of the war. The third answer choice can be inferred from the claim that the United States hoped to keep Eastern and Central European nations away from Soviet influence, meaning that the United States and the Soviet Union were not fully aligned in their views. After you are told that the Allied powers, too, had something to gain, the powers listed are the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. Poland, however, is listed among countries before the â€œtoo,â€ which means you cannot infer that it was an Allied power. (Make sure not to bring outside information into these types of questions. This is not a question about what you know about World War II â€” itâ€™s a question about whether certain things are actually written down in the passage.)"
"ABC"," The second half of the first paragraph lists the reasons why the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, respectively, had something to gain from the deportations. Each of the answer choices above undermines one of these reasons. Note the â€œif trueâ€ in the question stem. You are being asked to momentarily take each answer choice as a fact, and then determine whether that fact would weaken an argument from the passage. â€œIf trueâ€ questions can sometimes ask you imagine that wacky or unlikely things are true â€” donâ€™t let that distract you from the task at hand."
"C"," The passage describes the theory of quantum mechanics, how it models particles as probabilistic waves, and how it has been confirmed over the past 70 years. Answer choice (C) correctly incorporates all of these ideas into the main idea of the passage. Answer choice (A) is incorrect, as it does not address the theory of quantum mechanics, which is the overarching idea of the passage. (B) and (D) are both large claims that are out of the scope of the passage. Finally, although it is obvious from the passage that tests can and have been designed to test quantum mechanics, (E) does not express the main idea of the passage."
"A"," The passage states that Einstein was deeply troubled by the theory of quantum mechanics, and thus his quote must not be in support of the theory. Further, his reference to dice is to say that he did not believe the universe should be controlled by probability, but should be set. Therefore, (A) best expresses his motivation; he argues with the theory of quantum mechanics stating that particles should not be probabilistic in nature. (B) has no bearing on quantum mechanics, and thus cannot express Einsteinâ€™s motivation. (C) is out of scope because of the mention of causality. (D) both mentions Einsteinâ€™s religious beliefs, which are out of scope, and confuses Einsteinâ€™s being troubled by quantum mechanics with his lack of understanding. (E) makes a supposition you could not possibly know from the passage about Einsteinâ€™s religious beliefs."
"AC"," The first statement is a proper inference because passage states that A particle trapped in a closed box has some finite probability of being at any location within the box, meaning the exact location of the particle cannot be known. You know from the next sentence that opening the box will locate the particle, and thus you can deduce that the location cannot be known for certain without observing the particle. The second statement is incorrect, as the passage actually states the opposite: that measurements of position can be taken. The third choice is a correct inference because the passage states that quantum mechanics describes particles as waves and that quantum mechanics has been verified as true."
"AC"," According to the second paragraph, not knowing that they are seeing a theater piece allows viewers to avoid the etiquette of theatergoing and engage with the action and concepts of an unfolding drama as if these actions and concepts were real. This is a good match with the first statement. The third paragraph refers to â€œscripted charactersâ€ in invisible theater, so you cannot infer that invisible theater is best described as improvised. (It may be possible in real life for scripted characters to engage in improvised acting, but you cannot infer this from the passage.) Another reference to dialogue â€¦ set up by invisible theater performers weighs against invisible theater being improvisational. The third paragraph begins, Boal has documented various successful instances of invisible theater in which non-performers â€¦ take unplanned public-minded action in response to the dialogue and events set up by invisible theater performers. The last sentence of the passage also states that â€¦the goal of guerilla theater is to get people talking publicly. Thus, you can infer that actions taken by the audience once the performance is over can be one measure of success of a theater piece, and thus the third statement is true."
"A"," In the first sentence, the author calls invisible theater and guerrilla theater two forms of street theater with similar origins but very different approaches. This is a good match with (A). (B) is incorrect because the passage doesnâ€™t say which form is more effective. (C) is too broad and the evolution is not the focus. (D) fails because the passage states clearly â€” and describes in great detail â€” the fact that â€œinvisible theater conceals its performative nature whereas guerrilla theater flaunts it.â€ (E) is much too broad, as the passage does not cover all artistic life in public places."
"AB"," The first statement is true, as the third paragraph goes into great detail about invisible theaterâ€™s goal of encouraging public-minded talk, and the passage ends with â€œthe goal of guerrilla theater is to get people talking publicly.â€ The second statement is justified because you are told in the first paragraph that Both forms take place exclusively in public places. The third choice is only explicitly stated in regard to guerilla theater; invisible theater is only said to involve the audience."
"C"," The professors gave diplomas to the people who were the least able to answer questions as a way to mock the universityâ€™s decision. (A) does not have to be true because the passage merely discusses the form of the professorsâ€™ protest. (B) cannot be justified since it doesnâ€™t have to be true that the professors believed that result would follow. Similarly, (D) is wrong because it is not certain that the professors considered the legality of their actions. (E) is not justifiable â€” no information is given about any particular polices the professors decried."
"AC"," The first statement, if true, would contradict the assumption of invisible theater that removing the boundary between performer and audience encourages involvement. The second statement describes a very likely result, and a goal, of invisible theater, and thus would not â€œundermineâ€ the principle of invisible theater. The third statement describes a situation where the goal of invisible theater â€” a lively debate about public issues â€” was already happening, and invisible theater ruined it! This would definitely undermine the principle of invisible theater."
"ABC"," You are told in this passage that widespread genomic changes would wreak physiological havoc, such as cancer (statement I). You are also told in the second paragraph that many organisms have also adapted beneficial mechanisms to induce genetic change. In short, some genetic changes are bad, but others are beneficial. The third paragraph explains how genetic change is important to immune functioning (statement II), and the last line of the passage tells you â€œthis process is regulated by T cells to prevent harmful mutations,â€ so the third statement is also justified."
"C"," The word seemingly indicates that the changes are not really haphazard. â€œSeemingly haphazardâ€ refers to â€œprogrammed genetic mutation.â€ The â€œthisâ€ in this seemingly haphazard process of programmed genetic mutation harks back to â€œgenetic recombination,â€ so you can be sure that (C) is a match. Some of the other answers may be true â€” (D) certainly is â€” but do not answer the question."
"ABC"," Pro-death signaling is given in a list of cellular mechanisms that stymie genetic changes. Stymie means â€œhinder.â€ Statement I is true. These cellular mechanisms are called ubiquitous, which means â€œexisting everywhere,â€ so certainly they are â€œvery common.â€ Statement II is also true. In the final sentence of the paragraph, you are told, malfunctions in molecular players that safeguard against mutagenesis, such as the protein p53, have been implicated in diseases such as cancer. Since the malfunction of p53 may cause cancer, you can infer that p53, when properly functioning, may work against cancer. That means Statement III is also true."
"A"," You are told that T cells need a large repertoire of receptors in order to be able to recognize a wide variety of pathogens. Then: Relying only on a genetically encoded repertoire would be disadvantageously limitingâ€”analogous to having only a few dozen language phrases with which to respond to the nearly infinite potential combinations of words in a conversation. Instead, the repertoire is generated by a process of genetic recombinationâ€¦ In this analogy, the language phrases are the repertoire of receptors; just as a speaker must respond to a nearly infinite body of language combinations, T cells must also have a large repertoire so they can respond to a wide variety of pathogens. You are told that the way this repertoire is increased is through genetic recombination. Note that (B) is out of scope, (C) is the exact opposite of what is being described, (D) is a distortion based on another analogy in the passage (also, an analogy on the GRE would not be â€œmeant to elucidateâ€ another analogy!), and (E) refers to the first paragraph, not the analogy in question."
"A"," In the analogy referenced, the â€œlanguage phrasesâ€ are receptors that can respond to various pathogens. The nearly infinite potential combinations of words is what a speaker must respond to â€” the reason a speaker needs a wide repertoire of language. Similarly, the wide variety of pathogens is the reason T cells need such a wide variety of receptors."
"BC"," You are told that Haberman focuses the brunt of his criticism on teachers who have been insufficiently trained for the realities of the modern school environment and whose prejudices, lack of deep content knowledge, and excessive focus on order and discipline profoundly limit their effectiveness. The word compromise in the question stem means something like â€œhurtâ€ or â€œlimit.â€ Note that Haberman thinks that too much order and discipline is hurting teachersâ€™ effectiveness, so the first choice is the opposite of what you want. The other two choices match up with lack of deep content knowledge and prejudices, respectively."
"D"," The quotes are present to make the point that the students who are referenced â€” non-white, immigrant, or non-English-speaking children â€” are NOT exceptions. Rather, they are the class the teacher is poorly prepared to teach. Habermanâ€™s point is that the teacher is the problem, not the students. (E) seems to reflect a truth that Haberman is railing against, but has nothing to do with the question (â€œexceptionsâ€ refers to students, not teachers)."
"AB"," You are told that Decadent authors embraced artifice over nature, and that Huysmansâ€™s protagonist in an example of Decadent writing surrounds himself with perfume, among other items. You can thus infer that at least one follower of the Decadent movement considered perfume to be an example of artifice, and that he held it to have surpassed, or be superior to, natural entities. But you do not know that Huysmans enjoyed surrounding himself with the perfumeâ€”only that his character did so."
"ABC"," All three of the features are listed as characteristic of the Naturalist movement. Vehicle for the scientific method matches extending the scientific method, while focused on the effects of environment on shaping character and elaborated on the way inherited traits influenced human behavior both match the passageâ€™s claim that Naturalism stressed the influence of environment and heredity upon the individual psyche. If Decadent authors embraced any of these literary practices, this would bring their work closer in line with Naturalism."
"C"," In the first paragraph, you are told that one limitation of the classical method is the reliance on average measurements: it is impossible to distinguish a uniform population of cells expressing intermediate quantities of a molecule from a population composed of separate low and high expressers. This is a good match for choice (C). Note that (A) is precisely what you want to measure (not a limitation), and (E) is a distortion â€” it is not preferable to capture only average levels. This goes against the main point of both paragraphs."
"AC"," According to the passage, flow cytometry and RNA FISH are examples of single-cell measurement technology, so the first statement is true. Much of the wording in the second statement â€” it is impossible to distinguish a uniform population of cells expressing intermediate quantities of a molecule â€” is lifted from a sentence in the first paragraph, talking about classical methods â€” not the newer, single-celled measurement technologies. Finally, you are told that flow cytometry and RNA FISH have made it possible to capture â€¦ the distribution of the moleculeâ€™s expression within the population, which is a good match for the wording in the third statement."
"C"," You are asked for the choice NOT in the passage. You are told that Portugal once mined Angola for slaves and raw material, so (A) and (B) are out. The beginning of the passage concerns Portugal taking over Angola over a period beginning in the 16th century and culminating in the 1920â€™s, so kill (D). The passage refers to Angolan independence in 1975 â€” since that date is during the 20th century (1900â€™s = 20th century, 2000â€™s = 21st century, etc.), kill (E). You are told that a civil war in Angola lasted until 2002, not a war against the Portuguese, so (C) is the answer."
"B"," The grand stroke of irony the author refers to is Angola helping Portugal. Why is this ironic? You are told that the country that once mined Angola for slaves and raw material is now virtually helplessâ€¦ (B) is the best match. (A) and (E) are not at all ironic. While (C) and (D) at least present some kind of contrast, they are not the stroke of irony to which the author refers."
"E"," You are told that Gageâ€™s physical injury affected his personality, that the part of his brain that was damaged is now known to be related to morality, and that Gage literally lost one (or more) of the modules in his modular brain system. (E) is a good match. (A) is the opposite of what is being argued. (B) is not indicated by the passage (and really goes against common sense). (C) may be true but is not the reason the author presented the example. (D) relates to the previous paragraph, not to Phineas Gage."
"A"," The author is saying that, if the brain has a director, then that director would need its own director â€” and, presumably, that director would need a director, etc. The expression â€œbegging the questionâ€ isnâ€™t really about a question; the other two choices are traps."
"B"," A â€œunitary entityâ€ would NOT be split into parts, or modules. While Aristotle and Descartes believed that the mind survived death, and lived long enough ago that they couldnâ€™t have been aware that certain aspects of personality are known to be controlled by certain areas of the brain, the question is not only about Aristotle and Descartes â€” it is about all advocates of a unitary view of the mind (you are told that, historically, that includes â€œvirtually every thinkerâ€). You simply do not have enough information about these thinkers to know whether they think the mind survives death, or whether some of them (more modern thinkers, presumably) are aware of current research into the brain."
"A"," The first paragraph of the passage stats that oxytocin treatments are often tried in isolated cases and the overall effects are without evaluation. The passage then describes a small study that seems promising, but makes no definitive claims. Therefore, it is likely that the author would agree that the effects of oxytocin require further evaluation. Answer choice (B) is incorrect, as the passage states the opposite, that oxytocin is not a â€œcure-all.â€ Although the author focuses on the effects of oxytocin for those that are not able to interpret social cues, answer choice (C) is incorrect, as the author does not state that the drug would not be useful for those that can already do so. The author specifically addresses (D) in the passage, stating that the hormone oxytocin increases feelings of calm and social bonding. Finally, answer choice (E) is incorrect, as the author never addresses oxytocin as an oral treatment."
"D"," The passage states that, the experiment showed that the oxytocin had the greatest affect on those who were least able to evaluate emotions properly when given the control. Thus, you can infer that those with the least ability to naturally infer emotions, e.g., the ones who might need it most, reaped the greatest benefits of the hormone. Additionally, (A) is incorrect, as the passage does not discuss inconclusiveness based on sample size. (B) is incorrect, as it incorrectly pairs the known effects of the hormone in the brain with the results of the student study. (C) is incorrect, as the passage does not address the ability of the students to recognize expressions, just the relative change between the controlled salt water dose and the oxytocin. Finally, (E) is incorrect for a similar reason: the passage does not state that the subtler the expression the more difficult it was for students to identify, just that some expressions that were used were subtler than others."
"A"," The experiment was related to studentsâ€™ ability to recognize emotions from facial expressions, not their ability to tell faces apart. (B) is mentioned in the first sentence of the last paragraph of the passage. (C) is addressed throughout the second passage, first when it is stated that, either a control dose of salt water was given and then by comparing awareness after exposure to oxytocin to the controlled salt water dose. (D) is explicitly stated in the second sentence of the second paragraph. Finally, (E) is explicitly addressed in the last sentence of the second paragraph."
"BC"," You are told that Anansi originated with the Ashanti people in Ghana, so the first statement is untrue. However, you are told that in Jamaican folklore, Anansi outsmarts other animal-god characters, so those characters must exist. Since Anansi is called â€œAunt Nancyâ€ in the United States and is from Ghana, Anansi is known on at least two continents."
"A"," In the first paragraph of the passage, the author describes the discovery of the cosmic microwave background. In the second, he or she explains why the cosmic microwave exists and its implications to science. Therefore, the author writes this passage to describe the discovery and reason for the cosmic microwave background. Answer choice (B) is incorrect, as the author cites one example of an accidental discovery, but does not explain how multiple discoveries can be made accidentally. (C) and (D) are incorrect, as the author does not argue or defend, respectively. Finally, the main theory presented in the passage is the cosmic microwave background, whereas (E) incorrectly makes it seem as though the authorâ€™s intent is to defend the Big Bang and that the cosmic microwave background is only a subordinate idea."
"C"," The second sentence in the first paragraph states that just an instant after the Big Bang, all matter in the universe was so energetic, or hot, that it existed as free particles known as quarks. The paragraph proceeds in sequential order, and thus this event happened soonest after the Big Bang. The events described in (A) and (B) are said to have happened approximately 400,000 years after the Big Bang. Answer choice (D) describes the present state of the cosmic microwave background, 13.6 billion years later. Answer choice (E) is never addressed in the passage, and thus cannot be the correct answer."
"D"," The passage states that Penzias and Wilson accidentally discovered the cosmic microwave background, and did not even understand what they had found until after consulting the Princeton group. Clearly, they did not initially understand the implications of their result. (A) is incorrect, as the passage does not describe the important of the signal for which Penzias and Wilson were originally searching. (B) is incorrect, as the passage never discusses the Princeton instrumentation used for searching for the cosmic microwave background. The capabilities of the telescope used by Penzias and Wilson is never discussed, thus (C) is not supported. Finally, the opposite of (E) is stated in the passage, which says that Penzias and Wilson convinced themselves that their signal was real before approaching the Princeton team."
"BC"," Sousa argues against mechanical music based on the grounds that it is insincere, and that it will decrease music in the home and music played or sung by amateurs, as well as music instruction in education. The first statement is an example of one of the things Sousa was afraid of â€” vocal instruction being less a normal part of education â€” and thus does not â€œcontradict.â€ The second statement is an example of the phonograph increasing amateur music playing and â€œdomestic music,â€ so this does contradict Sousaâ€™s point. Finally, the third statement is an example of recorded music being more sincere than live music, so this definitely contradicts Sousaâ€™s point."
"D"," Here, chest really does mean â€œpart of the human body,â€ not â€œa trunk or treasury.â€ The statement about the â€œnationalâ€ throat and chest comes right after a worry that music will become the province of machines and professional singers only. Thus, the â€œnational chestâ€ is a reference to regular peopleâ€™s singing."
"","The blackbody emits just as much energy per unit time as it absorbs; the electromagnetic spectrum of the emitted energy, howeverâ€¦ (second sentence). The second sentence of the paragraph, after the semicolon, states that the electromagnetic spectrum of the emitted energy of a blackbody is completely determined by temperature and no other properties. Therefore, the only variable that defines the electromagnetic spectrum of a blackbody is temperature, as stated in the second sentence."
"A"," The passage states in the first sentence that an idealized blackbody is an object that reflects zero incident electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, if an object reflects incident electromagnetic radiation, it cannot be an idealized blackbody and the first statement can be properly inferred. The second statement, however, cannot be inferred as the passage states that a possible Doppler shift can cause a fundamental change in the original spectral characteristics of reflected electromagnetic radiation. Finally, for the third statement, the passage states that any object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation is a perfect blackbody. However, you are told that a microscopic â€œforestâ€ of vertically aligned single-wall carbon nanotubes of varying heights applied to a surface is the closest that scientists have come to thus far creating a perfectly dark material, implying that this material is not a perfect blackbody. Therefore, you cannot properly infer that this object will absorb all incident radiation."
"D"," Choice (A) is wrong, since there is no reason that one cannot produce original research by using techniques developed by someone else. (B) may be true, but this is not implied by the use of the word borrowing, since all you know is that one technique from evolutionary biology proved helpful to research in linguistics; this is compatible with the two areas having no common features. (C) is wrong, since the fact that methods from outside fields can help make progress in linguistics does not show that such progress cannot be made by other means. (D) is correct: research methods developed in evolutionary biology can lead to results in linguistics. (E) is the opposite of what the passage tells you."
"","But given that some language is spoken by virtually all human beings, it would be strange if it did not reflect cognitive universals. While it may be tempting to select the second sentence of the passage, this sentence does not give any support for universalism; it only tells you the grounds on which Chomsky came to a universalist view. On the other hand, the penultimate sentence of the passage does provide support for universalism by noting that it is likely that all languages reflect features innate to human thinking, since virtually all human beings speak some language."
"B"," Choice (A) is wrong, since the passage gives examples of non-empirical ways to support universalism. (B) is correct: Grayâ€™s team claims their research casts doubt on Chomskyâ€™s theoretical conclusions. (C) may or may not be true, but the passage only points to evidence of features that do not co-vary. (D) is wrong: you know that Grayâ€™s team found no evidence of the existence of family- invariant rules, but this does not prove that there are no such rules. (E) is wrong: Chomsky argued that universalism is the â€œbest explanationâ€ for the speed at which children learn a language, but that does not mean that no other explanations are possible."
"B"," The passage highlights two key points as they relate to each other: the two competing theories of the universe and Hubbleâ€™s discovery that the universe is expanding. The correct answer, (B), highlights both of these points and their relation to each other. (A) and (C) highlight only one of these points each. (D) describes Hubbleâ€™s law, which does not fully capture the main idea. (E) is not an idea presented in the passage, and therefore cannot be the main idea."
"E"," The passage states that, Milton Humason, a fellow astronomer, helped Hubble to calculate the starsâ€™ relative velocities to Earth, but nowhere in the passage does it say that Hubble deduced the velocity of Earth or the starsâ€™ absolute velocities. (A) is mentioned at the beginning of the second paragraph when the author states that, Using this relation and years of observing. (B) is mentioned in the first and fourth sentences of the second paragraph. (C) is stated in the second to last sentence of the second paragraph. Finally, (D) is addressed in the second and third sentences of the second paragraph."
"AB"," The passage states that Hubbleâ€™s experiment was proof that you do not live in a steady-state universe, therefore it must be true that the steady-state universe theory does not allow for an expanding universe, and the first statement can be inferred properly. The passage also states that the speed at which objects are moving away from each other in space increases with an increasing distance between the objects. From this, you can properly infer that as the distance between two objects decreases, the speed at which they move apart must decrease. Thus, the second statement can be properly inferred. Finally, the third statement incorrectly assumes that once the steady-state universe theory was disproved, the Big Bang was the only theory that remained. The first sentence of the passage states that most physicists believed in one of the two theories, leaving the possibility of many more theories that might still agree with Hubbleâ€™s discovery."
"A"," The argument of the passage dismisses the assumption that the gods determine destiny by pointing out that they act â€œpolitically,â€ and their agendas often conflict, so that they could not formulate a â€œmaster plan.â€ But if the gods had a common goal, then this objection would no longer apply. On the other hand, if the agendas of the gods coincided with the demands of fate, that wouldnâ€™t support the idea that the gods were in charge of fate, so (B) would not support the assumption. If Homer and Hesiod disagreed about the motives and agendas of the gods, as (C) claims, that would not undermine the view that for both authors fate is beyond the gods. Nor would the claim that destiny would be fulfilled regardless of what the gods did â€” choice (D) â€” or the idea that the gods and mortals can make their own decisions, so long as these decisions ultimately led to the fulfillment of destiny."
"B"," This is the most common sense of the term unbiased, and is the only one that fits in this context. (A) is clearly wrong since you are told that the role of the gods is a motif in the Histories. Since Herodotus provides an account of conflicts in the Hellenic world, (C) is wrong. (D) is wrong since you are told that the concept of destiny is part of Herodotusâ€™s history, so the actions of people and states by themselves cannot explain the events involved. As for (E), there is no indication that the histories were meant to challenge anyoneâ€™s sensibilities."
"ABC"," The first statement paraphrases the claim that the gods act within certain boundaries, while the second statement paraphrases the claim that they do so to accomplish his or her own agenda. The third statement is the main point of the passage: that the gods act as agents of destiny which they do not themselves control."
"C"," Chemical blockers scatter, or disperse, light waves. Chemical absorbers use them to promote electrons which then release them as light waves with a longer wavelength as they return to their ground energy state. (A) makes a reference to lightening and darkening light waves, neither of which is mentioned in the passage. (B) and (D) refer to converting light waves to radiation, which is impossible since light waves are already radiation. And absorbers absorb the radiation into their molecular structure, not into the skin as in (E)."
"D"," The chromophores absorb light in the 290â€“320 nm range and use it to promote (or move up) electrons between energy levels. Since light with wavelengths of 300 nm falls in this range, their electrons should move up in energy levels when exposed to it. (C) would be correct if not for the range given: you donâ€™t know how chromophores react to light above 320 nm. (B) is the exact opposite of what you are looking for. (A) applies to physical blockers but not to chemical absorbers."
""," In order to select a chromophore for a particular sunscreen, you would need to know which light waves the sunscreen needs to block and which chromophore would block those waves. This sentence tells you which feature of a chromophore determines which light waves it absorbs. The next sentence in the passage might seem like a good match, but it only tells you how to select a chromophore that would absorb UVB radiation, not UVA radiation."
"C"," The first statement is not true, because you are told For all we know, the story may have been Christianized in its oral form long before the poet set it into writing. The second statement is incorrect because you cannot make a leap from The story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight has its foundation in Arthurian legend to Sir Gawain was a knight in King Arthurâ€™s court. The third statement is true, and a good match for the final sentence of the passage, which tells you that you do not know whether the tale is a pagan interpretation of Christian ideals or an externally imposed Christianization of pagan codes of behavior."
"E"," Choices (C) and (D) are directly contradicted in the passages. Nothing suggests that the religious outlook of the interpreter influences their interpretation of the story, so (A) is also wrong.(B) is too strong: the passage only states that, according to its interpretation of the story, Gawainâ€™s motives are not Christian. But this doesnâ€™t show that they could not be. (E), on the other hand, follows directly from the claim that while Gawainâ€™s actions and words are Christian, his motives are not."
"B"," The theory in the final sentence is that the poet associates Gawain with a pagan symbol and then portrays his â€œChristianâ€ virtues as superficial in order to criticize the pagan interpretation of Christianity. Choice (B), if true, would show that the poet was, at very least, inconsistent in this message (or, possibly, the part about Gawain being superficial in his virtues is really just about Gawain.) Choice (A) is true and described in the passage, so it would not â€œundermineâ€ the theory. Choices (C), (D), and (E) do not address the interplay between paganism and Christianity and thus have no bearing on the theory."
"AC"," Since Astyages reacted to his first dream by altering the marriage arrangements for his daughter (in order to select a less threatening husband), you can infer he believed her husband could be a threat. And since he intentionally selected a Persian rather than a Median, you can infer that he thought a Persian would be less of a threat. However, although you are told that Astyagesâ€™ dream was interpreted ominously by the Magi and that as a consequence, he pursued a course of action (indicating that this time, he was influenced by the Magi), you donâ€™t know that he thought it was â€œalwaysâ€ best to obey the Magi, nor is it clear that the Magi made â€œrecommendations.â€ Watch out for extreme language."
"A"," One of the two mistakes referred to in the passage was marrying Mandane to Cambyses. But if her son would have deposed Astyages even if he had had a different father, then altering what would have been the normal treatment of her marriage was not a mistake that led to Astyagesâ€™s downfall."
"B"," The passage makes the case that Bierstadtâ€™s work, which is called optimistic and gaudy, was no longer suited for the prevailing trends in art in American after the war. The optimism that once characterized American preferences is now â€œtemperedâ€ by the â€œhorrors of war.â€ In other words, Americans are beginning to take a more realistic approach to life, in a way that is sadly reflective of the disastrous things that can befall a country. Their attitude, in other words, is one of somber realism. Donâ€™t get misled into picking prideful idealism by the fact that the passage mentions American pride. The passage does not imply that there was anything idealistic about the new American attitudes after the Civil War. (A) may also be tempting but the author never makes any sort of claim as to whether the new American attitudes are misguided."
"E"," A central thesis of the passage is that the same elements that initially made Bierstadtâ€™s work popular eventually contributed to its downfall. These elements were, in short, an emphasis on size and quantity rather than emotionality. The quoted phrase is a criticism of his work to this effect, providing a specific example of the opinion of the time. (C) may be tempting, but this phrase may or may not be the opinion of an expert, plus â€œproviding expert testimonyâ€ is not the best description for the purpose of the phrase."
"C"," You are told that Bierstadt â€œdeveloped a fixed style that was most easily recognizable for its sizeâ€ (A), that he had an â€œability to represent the optimistic feeling in Americaâ€ (B), that he â€œdeliberately appealed to those rich patronsâ€ (D), and that patrons could purchase a â€œhyperbolized replica of a Western vistaâ€ (E). The increasing attention to â€œsubdued appreciation for the details of American lifeâ€ is mentioned in the second paragraph as a trend that worked against Bierstadt."
